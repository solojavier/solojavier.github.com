Hello World. I've decided to create a personal blog to post entirely in github. Here I will start to share some of my ideas and I hope someone would be interested out there. 

This is also a first step towards creating a blog with my geek co-workers at "wowzer":http://www.wowzer.com . So this is just a little test to see if it's viable or we should all just go to wordpress or something like that.

:)
